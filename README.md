> **Collapse the surge.** When a storm, outage, or recall makes 40 people report the same thing, All Clear deduplicates those **signals** into a handful of real **incidents**, routes each by severity and SLA, and drives a live map that flips green when everything is resolved.

> 🧬 **Heritage.** All Clear is the production pivot of [**47 Doors**](https://github.com/EstablishedCorp/47doors). The same three-agent shape — classify → route → act — is rebuilt on the **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** for incident triage in public safety, customer comms, and regulated industries.

---

## 📖 Overview

All Clear is a MAF-based triage pipeline that turns a flood of inbound **signals** into a small, accurate set of **incidents** so responders work the *event*, not the noise. Each signal flows through one coordinated pipeline that:

- 🎯 **Classifies intent** from a single inbound signal (chat, voice, phone, or report)
- 🧲 **Deduplicates** by embedding similarity — duplicate signals **attach** to an open incident instead of spawning new ones
- 📊 **Tracks magnitude** — every attached report increments the incident's public-impact counter
- 🔀 **Routes by queue** (field-operations, customer-comms, compliance-desk, engineering, escalations)
- 🚦 **Maps severity & SLA** deterministically (SEV1–SEV4) — rules, never model vibes
- 🎫 **Opens incidents** and **searches knowledge** only on the non-duplicate path (keeps surge latency flat)
- 📝 **Generates sitreps** — citation-grounded situation reports where every claim cites a source
- 🛡️ **Escalates to humans** on safety/PII/sentiment rules — a security control, not a refactor
- 🗺️ **Drives the ClearBoard** — a live map where incident pins visibly merge as reports attach, SLA breaches highlight, and the board flips to its green **all-clear** state

**🎯 The hero scenario:** a **surge** where most signals are duplicates of a few incidents. All Clear keeps the responder's queue proportional to *incidents*, not *signal volume*.

### 🗺️ Solution Architecture

![All Clear solution overview](./docs/architecture/allclear-architecture-overview.png)

## 🧱 Domain Language

One canonical term per concept (see [`CONTEXT.md`](./CONTEXT.md) — if code and that doc disagree, the doc wins).

| 🧩 Term | 📝 Meaning |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 📡 **Signal** | One inbound communication on any channel. Never deduplicated away; always attributable. |
| 🔥 **Incident** | The real-world event signals describe (`AC-####`). Has severity, queue, SLA clock, magnitude, status. |
| 🔗 **Report** | The association of a signal to an incident; attaching one increments magnitude. |
| 📊 **Magnitude** | Count of reports on an incident — a proxy for scale; drives ClearBoard weight. |
| 🚪 **Queue** | Destination work stream (replaces 47 Doors' "department"). |
| 📝 **Sitrep** | Citation-grounded situation report from `generate_sitrep`. |
| ✅ **All clear** | Terminal state — every incident resolved, every SLA satisfied. Also the product name. |
| 🌊 **Surge** | Inbound volume spike where most signals are duplicates. The hero scenario. |
| 🗺️ **ClearBoard** | Live map view: pins merge on dedup, magnitude counters, SLA breach highlighting. |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 🔄 Three-Stage Pipeline

Three input modalities — text chat, browser voice (WebRTC), and phone (ACS/PSTN) — all route through the **same** pipeline. Each agent has **bounded authority**: it can do only what its role and tools permit.

![All Clear agent pipeline](./docs/architecture/allclear-agent-workflow.png)

1. 🎯 **QueryAgent** *(MAF agent, `app/agents/query_agent.py`)* — classifies one signal into intent, entities, severity indicators, and PII flags. Authority: **classify only**.
2. 🔀 **RouterExecutor** *(deterministic MAF workflow, `app/agents/router_agent.py`)* — **zero LLM calls by design and by test.** Runs dedup → severity/SLA mapping → escalation rules → a `RoutingDecision`.
3. ⚡ **ActionAgent** *(MAF agent, `app/agents/action_agent.py`)* — exactly three tools: `create_incident`, `search_knowledge`, `generate_sitrep`. Authority: only what its tools permit.

> 🧲 **Dedup keeps surges flat.** At or above `DEDUP_THRESHOLD` (default **0.83** cosine) a signal **attaches** to an open incident (`ATTACH_TO_INCIDENT`) — magnitude increments, the reporter gets a short ack, and **no knowledge search runs**. Below it, a new incident opens (`OPEN_INCIDENT`) and the full ActionAgent path executes.

### 🚦 Severity & SLA

Severity is mapped from classification indicators by RouterExecutor rules — never by the model. Thresholds live in [`config.py`](./backend/app/core/config.py), never in code.

| 🔺 Severity | 📋 Meaning | ⏱️ Response SLA |
| :---------: | ---------- | :-------------: |
| 🔴 **SEV1** | Life safety, total outage, statutory clock running — immediate escalation | **15 min** |
| 🟠 **SEV2** | Major impairment, public-facing, spreading | **1 hr** |
| 🟡 **SEV3** | Contained, single-party impact | **4 hrs** |
| 🟢 **SEV4** | Informational, routine request | **Next business day** |

> ⚖️ A **statutory clock** (breach-notification / recall windows) forces SEV1 regardless of other indicators. Breached SLA clocks highlight on the ClearBoard and are written to the audit log.

### ☁️ Azure Infrastructure

![All Clear Azure deployment](./docs/architecture/allclear-deployment-infrastructure.png)

| 🔧 Service | 📝 Purpose |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 🤖 Azure OpenAI | Signal classification + sitrep generation (`gpt-4.1` family) |
| 🧠 Azure OpenAI Embeddings | `text-embedding-3-small` for dedup similarity |
| 🔍 Azure AI Search | Knowledge base retrieval (`text-embedding-ada-002` index) |
| 📦 Container Apps | Backend API hosting |
| 💾 Cosmos DB | Incident / audit persistence *(provisioned; live store mock-backed today)* |
| 📞 Communication Services | Phone (PSTN) intake + call automation |
| 🔐 Key Vault | Secrets management |

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 🟡 Mock mode (offline, zero Azure credentials) — start here

The **entire** pipeline runs offline against mock twins of every Azure service. Every live service has a mock twin and they stay in lockstep.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows  (use: source .venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the full pipeline offline — deterministic, no Azure needed
$env:ENVIRONMENT="test"; $env:MOCK_MODE="true"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

```bash
# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> 🧪 Mock mode is enabled by `MOCK_MODE=true` / `USE_MOCK_MODE=true`. `Settings.use_mock_services` is also true in the `test` environment.

### 🔵 Deploy to Azure with `azd`

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```

`azd up` provisions the Bicep stack in [`infra/`](./infra/) and deploys the backend to Container Apps. The `postdeploy` hook prints the backend URL and its `/api/health` endpoint.

## 🛡️ Security Posture

All Clear adopts a **CJIS mindset** everywhere — even where it doesn't legally apply: least privilege, full audit, no PII echo. **Escalation logic is a safety control**: code that weakens it is a security blocker, not a refactor. Each agent operates under **bounded authority** enforced by code structure (tools, interfaces), not prompt hope.
